- In this thirdParty-directory get libarchive-library
(more information in: http://libarchive.orgi/)

    git clone git://github.com/libarchive/libarchive

OR

    git clone https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive


- change into libarchive directory

    cd libarchive

- execute autogen.sh

    build/autogen.sh


On some systems, may need to use an older release version instead.
For example,

    cd libarchive
    git checkout -b release-3.6.2 v3.6.2


- then configure the installation process to use this build location

    ./configure --prefix=$(pwd)/build

- compile with

    make

- and install with

    make install

- on some systems (eg, openSUSE) the libraries will be installed under
  'lib64' directory, but various other bits of the code link against a
  'lib' directory. So it may be necessary to create that directory

   (cd build && ln -s lib64 lib)
